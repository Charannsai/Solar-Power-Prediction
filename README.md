# **Solar Power Output Prediction**

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the solar power output using linear regression model based on historical data. By analyzing various parameters such as temperature, precipitation, azimuth, and more, aim to identify trends and patterns that can help in forecasting future solar power generation.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **python, jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes historical weather data and solar power output measurements. It consists of several parameters such as:
- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Azimuth
- Solar Radiation
- Wind Speed and Many..

### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main sections:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical weather and solar power output data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data to identify trends and patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can help improve the prediction model.
5. **Model Building**: Constructing and training machine learning models to predict solar power output.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics.
7. **Prediction**: Using the trained models to predict future solar power output.
